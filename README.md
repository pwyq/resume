# resume
Author: Yanqing Wu

### Say something
I am tired of editing my resume on Word or something similar.
I also found that LaTex/Tex is not easy to adjust everything down to pixel (and there is extra learning cost).

Therefore, I use HTML+CSS to make my new resume. Hope you may like it.

### How To Use

TBD

### Tested Browser
Google Chrome

### TODO
1. Make it a template; easy to be edited.
2. Add Mobile Version?
3. Add demo files
